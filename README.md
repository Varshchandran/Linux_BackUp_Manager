# Linux_BackUp_Manager
This script backs up a source folder to a destination folder. Users specify paths as command-line arguments. A new folder with a timestamp is created in the destination folder, containing a compressed backup of the source folder. Each execution generates a unique timestamped backup folder for easy organization and retrieval.
